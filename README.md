# readpy

Converts PDFs into audio books to read on the go

The external libraries needed for this are:

- pypdf: used to read from pdf files
- requests: used to send API requests to and from Lovo AI

the required packages can be installed with the following commands

```
pip install pypdf
pip install requests
```

Since this project relies on the external Lovo API you will need to get an API key
to do this visit the `https://genny.lovo.ai/` website, create an account, and then click on your profile to view and generate API keys.

Once generated you can run the script as normal and input the API key when prompted.
